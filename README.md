# How-To Guides

This repository is a holding-place for the how-to guides for *true beginners* I am creating. Updates, changes, and recommendations are both welcome and encouraged. These guides are created step-by-step through my own process and experience doing each of these things. I expect to develop versions of these guides for Mac OS, Linux distros, and eventually Windows OS (once I have access to a Windows machine).

Please fork, update, and improve as you see fit!
